***Is Good Day correct grammar??
Both are perfectly correct. “Good day!”,
 however, sounds a rather old fashioned in British English,
 though it is commonly said in Australian English. Moreover,
 “good day” can be said at any time of the day,
 unlike “good morning” which would sound strange after midday.
